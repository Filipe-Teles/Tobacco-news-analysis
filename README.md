1. I collected 31 news pieces from the printing press about the attempt of the Portuguese government to implement a law that restricted the selling of tobacco in vending machines and to forbid smoking in several open air spaces.
2. I uploaded the PDF files containing the news pieces in Google's software Pinpoint.
3. After review of the news pieces, I identified the interest groups that were both in favor and against the government's law.
4. After an analysis of the mentions of these interest groups in the 31 news pieces, I created a Dataframe using Pandas and counted how many times these interest groups were mentioned.
5. I found out that, in 31 news pieces, the interest groups against the law were mentioned 36 times. On the contrary, those who favored the law were mentioned very much less.
6. Then I used Jonathan Soma's template "Scrollytelling with one long video" and adapted for my own story. You can see the template here: https://jsoma.github.io/page-templates/scrolly-video/index.html
7. You can find the result here: https://filipe-teles.github.io/Tobacco-news-analysis/
